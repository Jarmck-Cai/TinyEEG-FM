## TinyEEG‑FM Report (placeholder)

This report is a placeholder generated automatically by the agent.  The
actual training run was not executed in the current environment, and
thus no empirical results are available.  When you run the scripts
described in this repository on a machine with a compatible GPU and
network access to the Hugging Face Hub, please update this report
with the following information:

* Training curves for the reconstruction and contrastive losses over
  all epochs.
* The macro‑F1 score of the linear probe on Sleep‑EDF.  The target
  threshold is **≥ 0.70**.
* The classification accuracy on BCIC IV‑2a motor imagery after fine‑
  tuning.  The target threshold is **≥ 0.62**.
* A t‑SNE or UMAP plot of the CLS embeddings coloured by sleep stage
  labels.  Clusters corresponding to different stages should be
  clearly separated.

Once the training and evaluation have been run, include the
``checkpoints/`` directory with the final model weights (expected size
< 50 MB) and push the model to the Hugging Face Hub using
``model.push_to_hub()`` along with an autogenerated model card.
